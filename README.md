# Dijkstra Pathfinding Visualization

This project implements a Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm visualization in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element. Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the grid cells to create obstacles or walls.
3. The green circle represents the start point, and the red circle represents the end point.
4. The algorithm will calculate the shortest path around the obstacles.
5. Observe the visualization of the algorithm's progress and the final path.

## Customizable Colors

You can customize the colors used in the visualization:

- `backgroundColor`: Background color of the grid cells.
- `wallColor`: Color of the walls or obstacles.
- `startColor`: Color of the start point.
- `endColor`: Color of the end point.
- `pathColor`: Color of the path found by the algorithm.

Modify these color variables in the JavaScript code to suit your preferences.

## Features

- Interactive grid for drawing obstacles.
- Real-time visualization of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm.
- Start and end points for defining the path.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and enhance the project:

- Adjust the grid size and canvas dimensions.
- Experiment with different heuristics for pathfinding.
- Add additional features, such as diagonal movement or weighted edges.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
